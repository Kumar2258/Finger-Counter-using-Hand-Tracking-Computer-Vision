# Finger-Counter-using-Hand-Tracking-Computer-Vision
This project employs OpenCV for real-time finger counting via hand tracking. OpenCV analyzes video frames to detect and track hand position and orientation. The system associates tracked gestures with numerical values, like an open hand indicating five and two extended fingers representing the number two, ensuring precise real-time counting.
